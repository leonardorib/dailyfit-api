Node API for the [DailyFit App](https://github.com/leonardorib/dailyfit-mobile).

Designed to facilitate diets, counting total calories, proteins, carbohydrates and fats ingestion during the day, and mantaining a history of that data.

Inspired on applications such as MyFitnessPal.

This is an independent and personal project, with no commercial motivation. The main purpose is to practice and have fun ;).
