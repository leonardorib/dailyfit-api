# DailyFIT API - Assets

## Foods Table
This table is based on the TACO - Tabela Brasileira de Composição de Alimentos *(Brazilian Food Composition Table)*.

If you want to execute the API locally using the same data, you must import the data from this csv to the foods table in the PostgreSQL database after running the migrations.

There are many ways to do this. If using DBeaver, you can click with the right mouse button on the foods table, select "Import data" and follow the steps.
